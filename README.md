## Project Description

This is a static multi-page blog website built as a project to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Objectives

* Implement a multi-page site structure with navigation.
* Build a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
* Include JavaScript interactivity.
* Apply semantic HTML5 elements for better structure and accessibility.
* Deploy the project online.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including responsive design via media queries.
* **JavaScript:** For client-side interactivity (e.g., mobile navigation toggle, basic form handling, dynamic year in footer).

## Features

* Multi-page structure: Home, About, and Contact pages.
* Consistent navigation menu across all pages.
* Responsive design: The layout adjusts for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
* Mobile navigation toggle (Hamburger menu) for small screens.
* Semantic HTML markup.
* Basic styling and layout.
* Client-side handling for the contact form (prevents default submit, basic validation, console logs - **Note: This form does not send actual emails without a backend**).
* Dynamically updated current year in the footer.
