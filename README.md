## Project Description

This is a static multi-page blog website built as a project to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Objectives

* Implement a multi-page site structure with navigation.
* Build a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
* Include JavaScript interactivity.
* Apply semantic HTML5 elements for better structure and accessibility.
* Deploy the project online.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including responsive design via media queries.
* **JavaScript:** For client-side interactivity (e.g., mobile navigation toggle, basic form handling, dynamic year in footer).

## Features

* Multi-page structure: Home, About, and Contact pages.
* Consistent navigation menu across all pages.
* Responsive design: The layout adjusts for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
* Mobile navigation toggle (Hamburger menu) for small screens.
* Semantic HTML markup.
* Basic styling and layout.
* Client-side handling for the contact form (prevents default submit, basic validation, console logs - **Note: This form does not send actual emails without a backend**).
* Dynamically updated current year in the footer.

## Project Structure
This `README.md` file typically uses Markdown syntax (the `.md` extension stands for Markdown) and is automatically displayed on the main page of your repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine (or download the code files).
2.  Navigate to the `my-blog-project` folder.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (you can usually just double-click it).
4.  You can navigate to `about.html` and `contact.html` using the navigation menu or by opening their files directly.

## Deployment

This project is deployed online using [Choose your deployment service: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel].

* **Deployment Link:** [Insert the actual live URL of your deployed website here]

*(Optional: Briefly describe the deployment method used, e.g., "Deployed automatically from the `main` branch using GitHub Pages settings.")*

## Future Enhancements

* Create individual pages for each blog post.
* Implement a simple commenting system (would require a backend).
* Add more advanced JavaScript features (e.g., light/dark mode toggle, search functionality).
* Improve form validation and user feedback on the contact page.
* Add more visual polish and animations.
* Integrate a headless CMS for easier blog post management.
